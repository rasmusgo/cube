This program solves a Rubics cube using axial metric.
It is written by Rasmus Göransson based on the demonstrational
java package by Herbert Kociemba, see http://kociemba.org/cube.htm.

    SimpleSolver LFFUULFLLUFRDRBUBURUFDFLBDBLFLUDDRRRFBDRLRDFDURDLBUBBB

# GraphicalCube
Renders a Rubics cube and lets the user manipulate it by using the keyboard.
Spacebar scrambles the cube. Enter solves it (same solver as SimpleSolver).
